### READ THIS FIRST

This repo is intended as a scratch for figuring out the best ways to parse the Miiverse site. I don't really intend on this becoming a defacto project. As such, you _can_ fork, but I'm not going to accept PRs, because this was more intended to show my progress and not for some end product.

If you want to contribute, you should _instead_ go to [MiiWorse](http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?channels=%23miiworse), the Archive Team IRC channel, where the real work will be done.

The goal of this project is to

- Crawl each area of the Nintendo Miiverse Website, including discussion boards, drawings, and [Other Areas](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Miiverse)
- Find ways to parse and each bit of data that can be collected. Including all user data.
- Put it into a format where anyone (developers, users) can make use of it.

This program uses a previously worked on [Parser](https://github.com/drasticactions/MiiverseClient/tree/34e2acf9354ef178d54f8cc110eecf3be562b327), for a client app which never got started. However, the end goal is to port this parsing logic into something [Warrior](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) can use. 
But worst case is I'll keep updating this program and find a way to split off work for multiple instances can use.
