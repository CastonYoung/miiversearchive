The goal of this project is to

- Crawl each area of the Nintendo Miiverse Website, including discussion boards, drawings, and [Other Areas](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Miiverse)
- Find ways to parse and each bit of data that can be collected. Including all user data.
- Put it into a format where anyone (developers, users) can make use of it.

This program uses a previously worked on [Parser](https://github.com/drasticactions/MiiverseClient/tree/34e2acf9354ef178d54f8cc110eecf3be562b327), for a client app which never got started. However, the end goal is to port this parsing logic into something [Warrior](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) can use. 
But worst case is I'll keep updating this program and find a way to split off work for multiple instances can use.
